Should scan personal websites for links to source websites (soundcloud, myspace, etc)
'hot victory' last.fm issue
ISSUES specific: 'black joe lewis & the honey bears', 'yo gabba gabba', 'jo koy'
perhaps also scrape artistwiki.com. it's ugly as fuck but that doesn't matter here
for partentheses: figure out the relationship between the XXXX and the (YYYY). FUCK. matt badger (ravenna woods) for example. google both, if one returns a band entry, check the other against the members? THen format it that way? fuck
add comparison of boldtext and header in wikis
factor into genres: grammy wins. significant. (wikipedia)
beyonce's unicode still makes him choke
'in flames' doesnt work for some reason
fucking dude's name comes up as a genre for 'beady eye'
for genres under 3 words, format them with google the same way bandnames are formatted. to check if theyre an acronym
	need to follow image links on bandcamp if no name formatting immediately found. sometimes the first view is just an album view
	'oc notes' for some stupid reason gives me some guy's myspace named 'illgsek' or 'iLLa "G"'
crooked fingers locale is a last.fm (date-date)
bandcamp - last resort source for info
'love inks' isnt being found
'isis & the ghost' found wrong
'the loss' changes name cos 'the loss' is in the song name of another band. specify searching to the header
add to sources: ReverbNation, PureVolume
should prioritize genres with hyphens becausae they're all awesome
scapebot needs a "Force local" setting for places like the Comet. Some of these shitty local bands have generic names used by other shitty bands in other cities
only facebook? no genres? use genres of Influences if available
